# Transfer Learning Design of Experiments for DNA Optimisation

This repository contains the code for the DNA amplification experiments conducted for the paper
_Transfer Learning Bayesian Optimization to Design Competitor DNA Molecules for Use in 
Diagnostic Assays_ [1].

## Installation

To clone this repo use the command:
    
     git clone https://github.com/RSedgwick/TL_DOE_4_DNA.git

The code is written in Python 3.9. To install the required packages, ensure conda is installed and run the following 
command in the root directory of the project:

     conda env create -f environment.yml 

You also need to initialise the candas package by running the following command in candas directory:
    
     pip install -e ./

## Overview 

In this project, we propose a transfer learning Bayesian optimization method for competitor DNA molecule development. We
compare the performance of different transfer learning Gaussian processes within this framework. The models we compare are:
the multioutput Gaussian process (MOGP), an average GP (AvgGP), the linear model of coregionalisation (LMC) and
the latent variable multioutput Gaussian process (LVMOGP) [2]. We use cross-validation to compare the predictive accuracy 
of the different models and then compare their performance in a sequential Bayesian optimisation setting.

For each competitor DNA molecule we want the rate `r` to be as close to the target rate as possible and for the 
drift `m` to lie below a threshold value. Our inputs are the number of base pairs `BP` and the % guanine-cytosine 
content `GC`. We use an adapted expected improvement acquisition function to minimise the difference between 
the rate and target rate [3] and penalise drifts above a given threshold.

## Data 
The data used in this project was collected from the DNA amplification experiments conducted in the lab. The 
target variables were calculated in advance. See the paper for more details.

## Results

Results of the cross-validation experiments appear in Figure 5 of Sedgwick et al. [1]:
